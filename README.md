**No Leg Lenny** is a game that I made for [Juice Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gdb-juice-jam/entries).

The game has been made using Unity in 10 days, plus a few polishing days after the jam deadline.
The game is a platformer where you play as Lenny, a legless man who uses a gun to fire himself to the air
Lenny wants to reach the moon, and will go through sky and space to do so.
